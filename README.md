# Chap18dinnerOrder
In this project, you will use combo boxes to show the options for a dinner order. After the user has selected their choices for appetizer, main dish, and dessert, a click of the button will calculate the total cost of that order. In a more realistic scenario, the project would also create a ticket to send to the kitchen to make the order, but we will leave that for another time.

Here is a sample session. The left image is the launch of the program, the right image is after pressing the button. Note the total cost is in correct currency format, dollar sign with 2 decimal places.

Ch 18 Dinner

There are 3 options for each of the combo boxes:

It is suggested that you use Box Layout for the JFrame, and embed layout managers in JPanels for the different portions of the screen. Be sure to include EmptyBorders to move the text away from the left edges of the window.

In an Excel spreadsheet, create at least 3 test cases BEFORE you run the program for the first time. Determine what the cost will be for 3 different combinations of meal items. Then run the program and check that you got the correct results.

Take screenshots of the 3 executions of the program that match your test cases.

 

Submission: the Excel spreadsheet with test cases, the specified screenshots and the root folder for the project

 

Pay careful attention to the rubric for this assignment.

Note that you must use correct formatting in the code -- appropriate indentation is most important. You can use Shift-Alt-F to have NetBeans automatically format the code correctly. If the formatting is incorrect, it will be returned to you for changes with a grade of zero.

Note: You need to submit the whole project for these assignments. In File Explorer, go to the location where you created the project. There will be a folder with the name of your project -- that is the root folder of the project.  If you submit the root folder of the project, the instructor can run it on a different machine to grade it. If you don't submit the proper folder, it won't run on another machine, and the assignment will be marked with a zero.
